PYTHON 🐍

OVERVIEW 💡

•	This repository includes projects for beginners who have keen interest in learning python programming language. 
•	There are 4 projects and each project has included the core of python.

•	Loops (for loop , while loop)
•	Object oriented programing  (class , functions , etc )

1.	7 UP and 7 DOWN 🎲🎲
•	This is a game played on basis of prediction where the user have to guess whether the number will be more than 7 or less than 7.
•	In this game the user have to guess that the number will be more than 7 or less than or equal to 7. 
•	If the guess is same as users guess then they won the game , else they loose.
•	In this project we have created 2 different functions:
	Roll_dice() 🎲
	Play_	7_up_7_down  7️⃣
•	In roll_dice() function, we have used the random module to generate the number between 1 to 6 and returned the total of two dice.

•	In play_7_up_7_down() function  
	User input is taken to  ask the user for their guess if there input is not equal to ‘up’ , ‘down’ , ‘exact’  , an error will occur.
	Made the use of conditional statement to print the output according to the users choice.

🚀Execution 
•	 play_7_up_7_down()


2.	Dice Rolling Simulator
