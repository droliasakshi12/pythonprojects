<h1>PYTHON 🐍</h1>

<h2>OVERVIEW 💡</h2>

<h4>
   •This repository includes projects for beginners who have keen interest in learning python programming language. <br>
   •There are 4 projects and each project has included the core of python.<br>
</h4>
<br>
<h2>Concepts Covered 📌</h2> 
•	 Conditional Statement (if -elif – else )<BR>
•	Loops (for loop , while loop , Break)<br>
•	Object oriented programing  (class , functions , objects)<br>
•	Python Standard Libraries.<br>
•	Lists , dictionary <br>
</br>
<h2>Requirement</h2>
<b>Python version</b>
<br>

<h1>1. 7 UP and 7 DOWN 🎲🎲</h1>
•This is a game played on basis of prediction where the user have to guess whether the number will be more than 7 or less than 7.<br>
•In this game the user have to guess that the number will be more than 7 or less than or equal to 7. <br>
•If the guess is same as users guess then they won the game , else they loose.<br>
<br>
<b>•	In this project we have created 2 different functions:</b> <br>
        -  Roll_dice() 🎲<br>
        -  Play_7_up_7_down 7️⃣<br>
<br>

<b>•	In roll_dice() function:<br></b>
    - we have used the <b>random module</b> to generate the number between 1 to 6 and returned the total of two dice.
<br>
<br>
<b>•	In play_7_up_7_down() function  <br></b>
    -	User input is taken to  ask the user for their guess if there input is not equal to <B>‘up’ , ‘down’ , ‘exact’ </B> , an error will occur.<br>
    -	Made the use of conditional statement to print the output according to the users choice.
<br>
<b><h3>🚀Execution</b></h3>
<code>play_7_up_7_down()</code>
<br>

<br>
<h1>2.	Dice Rolling Simulator 🎲</h1><br>
•	Used the random function to generate the values between 1 to 6 as in dice.<br>
•	Included the use  of conditional statement to check for the conditions and print the output .<br>
•	Taking the input from the user to roll the dice or not.<br>

<br>
<br>
<h1>3.	Password Strength Checker 🔑🔏</h1><br>
•	This project is to check the strength of the password created by the user.<br>
<b>•	Created 2 functions:</b><br>
<code>
-	checkPass()
-	Validatepass()
</code>
<br>

<b>•	checkPass() :</b>
<br>
-	used the <b>Global</b> keyword  (variables that can be used outside the functions)<br>
-	Checking if everything is False. <br>
-	Used for loop to check the length  of the password , this is done to identify the strength of the password.<br>
<br>

<b>•	Validatepass():</b><br>
-	Taking the password input from the user  <br>
-	Checking if the password is ‘Strong’ , ‘Moderate’ , ‘weak’<br>

<br>
<br>

<h1>4.Snake and Ladders 🐍🪜</h1><br>
•	In this game there can be multiple players they have to roll the dice and have to make the move according to the number in dice. <br>
•	If the user ends at a number where there is a snake it will come backward or eaten by the snake. <br>
•	If the  user ends at a number where there is a ladder it will move forward or climb the ladder.<br>
<br>
<b>•	Functions created:</b></br>
<code>dice() Snl()
</code>
<br>
<b>• In dice() function :</b>
</br>  -So here a random number is  generated between 1 to 6 and each time the number is generated it is added.
<br>

<b>•  In snl() function :<br></b>
    -	Created a snake and ladder  variable which is a dictionary where the key and value is given. <br>
    -	According to the total value  of the dice the user will either climb the ladder or eaten by the snake.<br>
<br>
•	Used while loop to roll the dice each time user want it the total is equal to 100 they won the game , else it will keep running until the user reaches to 100.
